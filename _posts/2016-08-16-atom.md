### Install Atom ###

See [website][atom] (or scroll to bottom of [releases page for downloads][releases] on github)

For linux ignore any distro version and download latest version (at least 1.9.0) and:-

```bash
sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb # debian, mint, ubuntu
sudo pacman -S atom # Archlinux currently installs 1.9.9
```

Mac/Windows users could just download direct (or homebrew on Mac)

Tough luck if you want the 32 bit version on debian linux

### Install Package ###

From the atom editor install the `script` package by [Kyle Kelley (rgbkrk)][script]

### Running Sketches ###

_Important_

To pick up the local environment you should start atom from a terminal (gnome-terminal linux, mintty cygwin).
Also to run sketches with a `data` folder you should initially open the immediate folder.

From a terminal cd navigate to `~/k9_samples/contributed` or `~/k9_samples/processing_app...` folders. Then `atom tree.rb` to start `atom` with selected file, you should do this to use your local environment settings. With file on view use `Ctrl/Alt/Shift/O` to display the run options pop-up. Enter the path to the sketch directory, enter `k9` as the command and `--watch` as the command arguments and _either save profile for re-use_ or just run the sketch in watch mode. Edit the sketch (eg change background color) and it will reload on save see below.
