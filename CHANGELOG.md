**v0.3.0** Revert to similar architecture as ruby-processing-2.6.12, including changes that make jruby and PApplet use same classloader.  This change is required for JRuby-9.0.0.0 compatibility. Other changes include:- load `rpextras.jar` early (so it only get loaded once) and loading the `vecmath` and `fastmath` libraries by default.
